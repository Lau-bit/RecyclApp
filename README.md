# RecyclApp
A mobile app teamwork school project i collaborated in during 2022

A prototype of a hypothetical application that makes it possible for people to have their old furniture picked up and recycled by truck drivers. 

Created using React Native and Expo.

To run the app locally in the terminal:
Run "npm install" in IDE terminal after downloading files. Then run "expo start".
